# About this dataset
This collection of data is all that's needed for potential students - parents, counselors and more - to evaluate their choices in selecting a college or university that perfectly meets their needs. For instance: what is the total tuition & fees cost? What are student enrollment numbers? How have students rated this school? Which universities have been recognized as top institutions in academics by U.S. News & World Report? What admissions criteria do these schools evaluate when considering an applicant's profile? The answers lie within this dataset! 

# Research Ideas
        Developing a searchable database to help high school students identify colleges that match their criteria in terms of tuition, graduation rate, location, and rank.
        Identifying correlations between enrollment numbers and university rank in order to better understand how the number of enrolled students effects the overall ranking           of a university.
        Comparing universities with similar rankings in order to highlight differences between programsâ€™ tuition and fees as well as retention rates
